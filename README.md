# maglit-cli
A small python script to shorten links via maglit.me, over cli

## Features 

- [ ] Optional password protection - custom or randomly generated 
- [ ] Custom shortened link
- [ ] Randomly generating shortened links

## Todo

Somehow making the script unattended if inputs are passed to it already (such as the custom pass, or the link to shorten), making it useful when piping the output of a previous command (e.g ffsend) to this script to then shorten the link.
